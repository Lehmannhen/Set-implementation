## ----------------------- Set implementation -----------------------
This is a C program that implements a mathematical  set as an ADT.
The set is built using a sorted linked list of positive ints. To run the program the
user have to provide the maximum number of sets on the command line.
When the program is running the user gets prompted for a command that the program should carry out.
The commands are:
* 'm' or 'M'
    * User gets prompted for a subscript corresponding to that set (0 to n - 1)
      where n is the number provided on the command line.
